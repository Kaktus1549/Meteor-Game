# Meteor-Game
Meteor Game is a simple 2D game that I created as part of my Python course. The program uses the play library (replit-play) for visualization, images, physics, etc. The code isn't fully optimized, that's why it's long too, I tried to clean it up but the folder got lost, so if I have time I'll look at it more.

Libraries used:

+ **Replit-play** -> library used to create games in Python
+ **Random** -> for random number generation

# How to play the game?

To control the game you only need the W, A, S, D keys and the mouse. The game has 3 languages - English, Czech and Spanish ( this language was largely done by a translator, I don't speak that much Spanish). The game also includes a "**Tutorial**" option, whereby you will be able to run through the basic information of the game.
